# Deployment Debug: Missing Chapter Descriptions and Moods

## Issue
Chapter splash screen and reader don't show chapter mood and description when deployed, but work locally.

## Likely Causes & Solutions

### 1. Build Cache Issue (Most Likely)
The deployed version might be using an old build that doesn't include the updated sample data.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear build cache and rebuild
rm -rf dist/
npm run build
# Then redeploy
```

### 2. GitHub Pages Cache
GitHub Pages might be serving cached files.

**Solution:**
- Force refresh the deployed site (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages cache to clear
- Check if the issue persists

### 3. Browser Cache
Your browser might be caching the old JavaScript bundle.

**Solution:**
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
- Clear browser cache for the site
- Try in incognito/private mode

### 4. Vite Build Configuration
Check if Vite is properly including the updated data files.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if the built files contain the descriptions
grep -r "child.*laughter" dist/
# Should show descriptions in the built JavaScript
```

### 5. TypeScript Compilation Issue
Verify TypeScript is compiling correctly with the new optional fields.

**Solution:**
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
# Should show no errors
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Local Development:**
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Open a chapter - descriptions should show

2. **Check Built Version Locally:**
   - Run `npm run build && npm run preview`
   - Open a chapter - descriptions should show

3. **Check Deployed Version:**
   - Open deployed site
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
   - Open a chapter - descriptions should show

## Current Data Status
✅ Sample data has descriptions and moods
✅ Components properly check for `chapter.description` and `chapter.mood`
✅ TypeScript compilation passes
✅ Local development works

## Recommended Fix
1. Clear build cache: `rm -rf dist/`
2. Rebuild: `npm run build`
3. Redeploy to GitHub Pages
4. Hard refresh the deployed site
5. Test chapter splash screens

## Debug Commands
```bash
# Check if descriptions are in built files
grep -A5 -B5 "child.*laughter" dist/assets/*.js

# Verify build includes updated data
npm run build
grep -r "hopeful.*mood" dist/

# Test local build
npm run preview
```
