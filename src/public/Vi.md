# His shadow, the spotlight

## The Streetlight Sonata

He moved through the city like a traveling revival of some forgotten opera—all sweeping gestures and dramatic pauses that turned sidewalk cracks into stage marks. The war was a rumor written in someone else's alphabet, but here, where the shop awnings flapped like tired curtains, he performed as if the whole district were his velvet-boxed auditorium.

His morning began with the slow unfurling of gloves—always white, always spotless—each finger extended like the opening note of an overture. By noon he'd collected a chorus of street urchins who trailed behind him, mimicking his grand bows to lampposts and his conspiratorial whispers to storefront mannequins. The children didn't laugh so much as gape, their mouths perfect O's of proscenium arches.

When rain fell, his umbrella opened with the dramatic flourish of a parachute silk, and suddenly the wet pavement became his spotlight. He'd leap over puddles with the precision of a danseur, spinning his umbrella so droplets arced like diamond strings. Passersby found themselves smiling without meaning to, their own walks home suddenly feeling pedestrian in both senses.

By evening he held court at the fountain, producing playing cards from the mouths of pigeons and making cigarette smoke curl into perfect treble clefs. The night crowd sighed on cue, their collective exhale the wind section to his one-man symphony. Even the moon seemed to hang brighter when he tipped his hat to it, as if acknowledging a follow spot operated by gods.

Tomorrow, like any good matinee, the performance would begin again. The war might rage beyond the hills, the world might fray at its edges—but here, under these streetlights, the show was eternal.

No one thought to question why his gloves never stained. Why his shoes never scuffed. Why his laughter never once, not for a single fractured second, rang less than perfect.

The mask, after all, was the man.

The man was the mask.

And the greatest performance is one where the audience never thinks to ask what's underneath.

## Glass Box Sololiquy

The curtain fell the moment he locked his door.

His rented room was not a dressing room but a confessional booth where no god listened. The mirror, his sole audience, reflected back a stranger—a man still wearing the greasepaint grin like a poorly stitched scar. He peeled it off slowly tonight, wincing as the adhesive took pieces of him with it.

On the windowsill, the dried rose stood in its glass coffin. He'd found it three months ago outside the theater, its stem snapped mid-descent from some romantic gesture gone unclaimed. Every evening since, he'd turned it slightly toward the fading light, as if directing a reluctant actor toward its mark.

"Take your cue," he whispered.

The rose said nothing. It had forgotten how to play alive.

### The Backstage of His Mind
#### Act I: The Love Scene (Never Staged)
He rehearsed confessions to the rose's bent head. "I—" too sharp. "You—" too direct. The words curled up and died in his throat, becoming yet another joke he'd tell tomorrow to louder laughter.

#### Act II: The Tragic Reveal
In the blackout between streetlamp flickers, he pressed a fresh petal between his palms—a fossil in the making. The real performance was in the careful way he never let his fingertips tremble.

#### Act III: The Last Night of the Petals
The rose's remaining petals grew more perfect as they brittled. He'd trained them well. No audience would guess how long they'd been dead.
