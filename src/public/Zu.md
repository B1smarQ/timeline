# The Constellation of Maybe

## The Language of Almost

He walked toward love like an astronomer mapping stars—not with the blind faith of a worshipper, but with the quiet determination of one who trusts the sky even when clouds obscure it.

The possibility lived in his ribs like a second heartbeat. What if. What if. What if. Not the desperate chant of a beggar, but the steady metronome of a man who had learned to move through doubt without letting it move him.

He knew the equations:

Distance x Time = Either Or
Silence + Averted Eyes = Perhaps Not
But then—
A Shared Umbrella in Sudden Rain = The Universe Tilting

The fear was real. It curled at the edges of his coffee cup in the mornings, pooled in the hollow of his pillow at night. But it was not the director of this story, merely a passenger.

When she laughed, the sound was not a verdict but a weather pattern—something that happened to the air between them, not to him alone. When she was silent, it was not rejection but the necessary pause between movements in a symphony still being composed.

He did not armor himself against the no that might come. Instead, he practiced the art of tender observation: the way her fingers hesitated near the sugar bowl, how her shadow crossed his on the pavement like a temporary bridge. These were not guarantees, only evidence that love—like light—exists whether we witness it or not.

The path did not waver. His feet knew their way.

And if someday she turned to him and said "This isn't—", he would nod, and the sky would still be there. The stars would still be there.

But for now, he walked.
