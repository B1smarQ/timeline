# Where His Shadow Fell, the World Was Lighter

## The man who walked with laughter

The world is heavy. Hearts grow weary, shoulders bend beneath invisible burdens. Men toil, women weep, and children forget how to laugh.

But not where *he* walks.

They call him the Joy-Bringer, though he claims no title. Where others see shadows, he finds light. A beggar’s bowl is not half-empty, but half-full—and then, by his hand, overflowing. A widow’s tears are met not with pity, but with stories of her husband’s laughter, until her sorrow cracks like ice in spring.

Kings wage wars, merchants hoard gold, and philosophers debate meaning—yet none hold what he carries. For joy is not given, not earned, but kindled, a spark passed from soul to soul.

Some say he is a fool. Others whisper he is something older, something divine. He only smiles. "Joy is not mine," he says. "I merely remind the world it exists."

And so he walks on, leaving behind not footprints, but echoes—of laughter where there was silence, of light where there was none.

The world is heavy. But he is not.
