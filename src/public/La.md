# The man who fled in circles

## The art of unbelonging

He built his disappearance brick by brick.

The war never reached his doorstep—not the real one, with its uniformed men and barking loudspeakers—but another kind of siege was always coming. He saw it in the way shopkeepers' eyes lingered too long on his hands, in the way the wind carried voices that fell silent when he passed. They were measuring him for a coffin he wouldn't fit.

So he became a draft dodger of the self.

He sanded down his vowels until no accent could catch on them. Learned to laugh in the new way—sharp at the front of the mouth, like a door slamming shut. When they asked "Where are you from?" he'd shrug and say "Here" in a tone that made the word mean nothing at all.

His handsbetrayed him most. Still moved to bless himself the old way when passing churches. Still shaped the air when telling stories he no longer allowed himself to speak. Eventually, he took to wearing gloves—not the thick working kind, but thin leather ones that made his gestures look borrowed.
